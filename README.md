# Neural Network from Scratch MNIST Classification - ECE 4424
## How does this work? 
This 2 Layers Neural Networks is built from scratch with numpy package. The model is trained adn tested on Yann LeCun Dataset which can be found at http://yann.lecun.com/

The network is trained with Stochastic Gradient Descent.
## How do I run this neural network?
